        <li><strong>Prep: </strong>Add milk, maple syrup, vanilla and oats to any glass container with a lid. Stir well with a spoon. </li>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate: </strong>Overnight is the best to avoid dry oatmeal and give time for milk to absorb into oats. However, quick oats can be enjoyed after 6 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy: </strong>In the morning, stir and if overnight cold oatmeal is too thick, adjust with milk. Also add more maple syrup if desired. Heat in microwave or enjoy cold.</li>
