            <li>4 tbsp oil</li>

            <li>1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 green onions</li>
            <li>1/2 cup roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients for the chicken in a shallow bowl; cover and marinate for 10 minutes (if time allows).</li>
            <li>Whisk sauce ingredients together until sugar dissolves; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet, pan or wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, allow to heat up, then add marinated chicken. Fry chicken for 3-4 minutes while occasionally stirring, until edges are browned. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining cooking oil into the same pan/wok. Stir in garlic, ginger, chili diced peppers (capsicums) and Sichuan peppercorns and stir fry for 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Give the prepared sauce a mix, then pour it into the pan and bring it to a boil while stirring. </li>
            <li>Once it begins to thicken slightly, add chicken back into the pan/wok and mix all of the ingredients through the sauce until the chicken is evenly coated and sauce has thickened, (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Stir in green onions, peanuts and sesame oil. Toss well and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes to infuse all of the flavours together.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with steamed/cooked rice or fried rice</li>
        </ol>
